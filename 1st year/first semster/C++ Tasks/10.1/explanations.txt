When 'using namespace std;' is commented out in Critter.cpp, 
any unqualified name from the std namespace used in the code will cause a compile error. 
For example, the use of 'string' needs to be changed to 'std::string', 
and 'cout' needs to be changed to 'std::cout'. 

If the 'Critter::' prefix is removed from any 
member function definition in Critter.cpp, the compiler 
will not recognize it as a member function of the Critter class and 
will throw an error stating that the function was not declared in this scope.
 To correct this, the 'Critter::' prefix must be added back 
 to ensure the function is correctly recognized as a member of the Critter class.
