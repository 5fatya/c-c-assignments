/*Problem 3.9 Determine sum of two values in array
Language: C
Write a program which reads from the keyboard an integer value n followed by n double values as elements of an array with not more than 20 elements.
 Write also a function with the prototype: double sum25(double v[], int n);
which computes and returns the sum of the elements in v at position 2 and position 5. 
Check that positions 2 and 5 are valid within v, if not then print a corresponding message on the screen. 
In this case the function should return the value âˆ’111. Print the sum on the screen.
Your solution has to satisfy the requirements from the problem description 
and has to pass the following testcase and potentially other testcases which are uploaded. 
All characters are relevant for passing testcases including newlines and spaces.
